/**
 * A {@code Binding} calculates a value that depends on one or more sources. The
 * sources are usually called the dependency of a binding. A binding observes
 * its dependencies for changes and updates its value automatically.
 * <p>
 * While a dependency of a binding can be anything, it is almost always an
 * implementation of {@link ObservableValue}. {@code Binding}
 * implements {@code ObservableValue} allowing to use it in another binding.
 * With that one can assemble very complex bindings from simple bindings.
 * <p>
 * All bindings in the JavaFX runtime are calculated lazily. That means, if
 * a dependency changes, the result of a binding is not immediately
 * recalculated, but it is marked as invalid. Next time the value of an invalid
 * binding is requested, it is recalculated.
 * <p>
 * It is recommended to use one of the base classes defined in this package
 * (e.g. {@link swingfx.beans.binding.DoubleBinding}) to define a custom binding, because these
 * classes already provide most of the needed functionality. See
 * {@link swingfx.beans.binding.DoubleBinding} for an example.

 * @see DoubleBinding

     * {@link WeakInvalidationListener}, which means usually
     * a binding does not need to be disposed. But if you plan to use your
